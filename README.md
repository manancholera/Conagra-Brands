# Conagra-Brands

Our objective during this analysis is to develop meaningful insights from the data provided by Conagra Brands. 
The data includes information about the unit quantity and sales of different frozen vegetable brands. 
The dataset contains other factors such as region and date values that can be used to infer variances in sales across geographic areas throughout time. 
Our team was particularly interested in analyzing the changes in frozen vegetable sales before and after the beginning of COVID-19. We wanted to see if this global event might have an impact on sales and if so, which regions, brands, and categories of foods were most affected.

**_Summary Statistics Conclusion_**
Summary statistics establish a base measure by which we can compare results from our regression analysis. If the regression analysis results align with the summary statistics then the regression results are validated and can be used to make product or brand alterations. These alterations are intended to amplify sales by adjusting variables in certain regions or during certain times. Adjustments could be applied to region 2 in particular. This region has the lowest unit sales out of all 4 regions despite the average price being relatively low. Further analysis could determine the cause.

**_ANOVA Results_**
There is a significant difference between regions of the average log units purchased by consumers. The cause could be due to regions not being equally sized, price differences, or consumer differences. Brand preference could also contribute to some regions having higher units sold than others. This result aligns with our initial summary statistics.

**_Regression Analysis_**
1. How COVID affected Price Sensitivity
2. How COVID affected National Brands vs Private labels
3. How COVID affected regions differently
4. How COVID affected brands differently

**Conclusion**:
We recommend that Conagra takes advantage of consumer’s increased preference for national brand frozen vegetables over private labels by being mindful of consumer’s increased price sensitivities and decreasing prices where possible.
